The SQL UNION operator combines the result of two or more SELECT statements.

{ each SELECT statement within the UNION must have the same number of columns. The columns must also have similar data types. Also, the columns in each SELECT statement must be in the same order}


-- Find a list of employee and branch names
SELECT employee.first_name AS Employee_Branch_Names
FROM employee
UNION
SELECT branch.branch_name
FROM branch;

-- Find a list of all clients & branch suppliers' names
SELECT client.client_name AS Non-Employee_Entities, client.branch_id AS Branch_ID
FROM client
UNION
SELECT branch_supplier.supplier_name, branch_supplier.branch_id
FROM branch_supplier;
